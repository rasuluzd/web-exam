                making it harder to differentiate between genuine and AI-generated content. One could also say that banning AI campaigning is infringing on your freedom of speech by limiting your freedom of expression.  
                Politicians who use AI campaigning as a tool for policies will now be compromised as shown by the source below. A blank ban could hinder technological progress and innovation.  
                It will be the voters who will benefit from this law as they lessen the risk of misinformation and deepfakes. This law can also lead to a general increase in trust throughs the politicians and the government due to the lessened risk of false information. 
                A ban on a type of technology may lead to loss of potential jobs, which could both be making AI campaigning or <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-cybersecurity.html" title="You´re about to leave this page" aria-label="Read more about cybersecurity"><p>Cybersecurity</a> against said technology. 
                Implementing this law would require significant resources for monitoring and enforcing the law. Examples may be developing robust AI detection mechanisms. The law should be accompanied by public education such as school education or public education campaigns to inform voters.

                My first impression is that the Norwegian government is right in their concern with their <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/939c260c81234eae96b6a1a0fd32b6de/norwegian-position-paper-on-the-ecs-proposal-for-a-regulation-of-ai.pdf" title="You're about to leave this page" aria-label="PDF of norwegian proposal of AI regulation"> proposal for regulation of AI </a>, 
                and the potential influence it can have the parliamentary election that is being held in 2025. 
                The build up towards 2024 election in the US confirms the suspicions towards unregulated AI-usage and I think something must be done in that regard. At the very least, should we should have some form of regulation so that we can, at the very least, know what is AI-generated and what is not.</p>

        <!--Text is a snippet from a DATA1100 assignment, not taken from the article linked-->
        <p>Building smart cities is related to society and technology as it takes use of technological structures and devices to improve living standards. This affects society as people’s day-to-day lives will change immensely. Everything will be digitalised, and AI will take over most manual jobs in these smart cities. However, people’s lives will be made easier, transport, among other things, will be made more efficient and there will be less room for human error. The collection of personal dat...</p>
